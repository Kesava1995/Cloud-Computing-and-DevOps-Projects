Project Agenda
To create high available architecture by distributing incoming traffic among healthy service instances in cloud services or virtual machines in a load-balanced set with the help of a command-line interface
 
Description:
The Rand Enterprises Corporation wants to deploy a web application in a highly available environment so that only the healthy instances will be serving the traffic so end users will not be facing any downtime. They have decided to work on an Azure public load balancer to implement the functionality.
The operations team at Rand decides to define the entire architecture using the load balancer and its backend pool, once thatâ€™s in place they intend to create the frontend IP and health probe along with virtual machines housing their application.
Rand Enterprises works extensively on delivering highly available web applications for their users in a secure way by avoiding directly exposing the virtual machines hosting the applications to the public internet. The communication from the application in the VM to the end-user must take place via the Load Balancer.
The expectation of the operation team is to create a reusable method that can be used for automation if in the future we need to deploy the same kind of infrastructure. So, rather than deploying resources in the Azure portal, they should leverage the command-line interface to deploy the resources so that in the future these commands can be used
As a security measure, you need to ensure that only the health instances of the virtual machine will be serving the traffic.

Step 0: Login using azure cli
Step 1: Create a Resource Group
Step 2: Create Virtual Network and Subnet
Step 3: Create Public IP for Load Balancer
Step 4: Create Load Balancer
Step 5: Create Health Probe
Step 6: Create Load Balancer Rule
Step 7: Create NSG and allow HTTP traffic
Step 8: Associate NSG to subnet
Step 9: Create two VMs without public IPs
Step 10: Get IP config names for NICs
Step 11: Attach VMs to backend pool
Step 12: Install IIS on both VMs
Step 13: Get Load Balancer IP
Step 14: See the output
